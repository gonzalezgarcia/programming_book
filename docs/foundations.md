- Statistics  
- Experiment design (online and lab-based).

## Overview of relevant languages (Python, R, MATLAB, etc.) and what they are best for:

- Python: General-purpose, data analysis, machine learning.  
- R: Statistical analysis, data visualization.  
- MATLAB: Signal processing, neuroimaging.
