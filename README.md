# How to use this repo

1. Clone the repository

2. Install [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/guide/getting-started)

3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory and run the following command to start a local server where you can view changes in real-time:

   ```bash
   npm run docs:dev
   ```
   
4. (_optional_) Once you've made your changes, you can build the documentation site by running:

   ```bash
   npm run docs:build
   ```
5. To effectively implement your changes, commit your changes to the repository. The website will automatically update with the latest changes.
